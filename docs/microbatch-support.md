# Microbatch models

`microbatch` is dbt-core's batched incremental strategy. This adapter implements it as
`incremental_strategy='microbatch'` on a `materialized='incremental'` model, and a batch is written
as a **partition overwrite**. Everything below was measured against a real MaxCompute project; what
is not listed is not verified.

The regressions that hold these statements in place live in
`tests/functional/adapter/incremental/`:

| File | Pins |
| --- | --- |
| `test_incremental.py::TestMicrobatchMaxCompute` | upstream's microbatch contract, on this warehouse |
| `test_microbatch_window_semantics.py` | windows, replay, empty window, late data, duplicate keys, rejected configurations |
| `test_microbatch_partition_timezone.py` | the session-timezone dependency described below |
| `test_microbatch_failure_retry.py` | what survives a batch that fails, and what `dbt retry` replays |

## How a batch is written

dbt-core computes the batch list from `begin`, `batch_size` and the run's event-time window,
re-compiles the model once per batch, and attaches a half-open filter
(`event_time >= <start> and event_time < <end>`) to every upstream ref or source that declares
`event_time`. This adapter then builds a temporary relation from that filtered query and runs

```sql
insert overwrite table <target> (select * from <tmp>)
```

On an auto-partitioned target - which is what `partition_by` with a time-typed field creates, and
what microbatch requires - MaxCompute replaces **only the partitions that appear in the batch's
rows**. Neighbouring partitions keep their rows, and a batch whose query returns nothing is a no-op.

| Situation | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Row exactly at `<start>` | written by this batch |
| Row exactly at `<end>` | left to the next batch |
| Re-running the same window | same rows; nothing appended twice |
| Window with no matching rows | target unchanged: nothing added, nothing deleted |
| Late row inside an already-written window | invisible until that window is replayed (or `lookback` covers it) |

Windows can be driven without touching any clock:

```
dbt run --event-time-start 2025-05-02 --event-time-end 2025-05-03
```

The two flags are mutually required, and they are what makes these runs reproducible.

## Requirements, and who enforces them

| Combination | Outcome | Enforced by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| no `partition_by` | rejected: "The 'microbatch' strategy requires a `partition_by` config." | this adapter |
| `partition_by.granularity` != `batch_size` | rejected: "requires a `partition_by` config with the same granularity as its configured `batch_size`" | this adapter |
| no `event_time` | rejected during parsing: "Microbatch model '<name>' must provide an 'event_time' (string) config" | dbt-core |
| no `batch_size` | rejected during parsing | dbt-core |
| no `begin` | rejected during parsing: "Microbatch model '<name>' must provide a 'begin' (datetime) config" | dbt-core |
| no `unique_key` | **accepted**; the model runs | nobody |
| the same `unique_key` twice inside one window | **both rows are kept** | - |

Read the last two lines before relying on `unique_key`: a batch is a partition overwrite, so
`unique_key` neither makes the write an upsert nor deduplicates, and nothing enforces that it is
set. For key-based updates use `merge` or `delete+insert`. (The example models in this repository
used to state that a missing `unique_key` raises a compiler error; it does not, and the comment is
corrected in the same change as this page.)

## The session timezone decides whether a window maps onto one partition

dbt renders the window as a timestamp string carrying an offset - `event_time >=
'2025-05-01 00:00:00+00:00'` - and MaxCompute evaluates that comparison on the **session** timezone
(measured: `+00:00`, `+08:00` and `-05:00` on the same wall clock select the same rows). The
partition a row lands in comes from `trunc_time(<field>, '<granularity>')`, which cuts on **UTC**.
Those two clocks have to agree, and what makes them agree is the session timezone:

* `MaxComputeCredentials._get_odps` sets pyodps' `local_timezone` to false when the profile omits
  `timezone`, and pyodps then submits `odps.sql.timezone=Etc/GMT` with every statement;
* with that default, one day window maps onto exactly one partition and two adjacent windows never
  touch the same partition;
* with `timezone: Asia/Shanghai` in the profile, the same fixtures behave differently: the window is
  read on the session clock while `trunc_time()` keeps cutting UTC days, rows before 08:00 local
  belong to the previous partition day, one "day" window covers two partitions, and the next
  window's overwrite erases rows the earlier window had written. The run reports success.

So `timezone` in the profile is not a display option as far as `microbatch` is concerned: it changes
which rows survive. Until the two clocks are reconciled in code - or the combination is refused at
compile time - **leave `timezone` unset for projects whose models use `microbatch`**.
`TestMicrobatchProfileTimezone` pins the failing combination as `xfail(strict=True)`, so it starts
reporting an error the moment the behaviour changes and can be deleted deliberately.

## Not verified here

- Python (MaxFrame) microbatch models, which apply the window to the returned DataFrame instead of
  to the compiled SQL;
- `batch_size` of `month` or `year`, and how their units interact with `trunc_time()`;
- `partitions`, `lookback`, `on_schema_change`, `grants` and model contracts on microbatch models;
- `dbt retry` for a model whose *first* batch fails.
